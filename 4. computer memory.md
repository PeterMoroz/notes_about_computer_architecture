The computer memory is a set of devices for store information, keep it for a period of time and return it back on request.
The operational parameters of memory devices depends on the physical principle of information storage, purpose and place in the computer architecture of the given device.
When memory device is accessed a transferring some portion of information (bit, byte, machine word).

The most important parameters of storage device are:
1. **Capacity.** The maximal amount of information which could be stored by memory device. The units of capacity are: 
1 Kb = 1024 bytes (2 ^ 10)  
1 Mb = 1024 Kbytes (2 ^ 20)  
1 Gb = 1024 Mbytes (2 ^ 30)  
1 Tb = 1024 Gbytes (2 ^ 40)  

3. **Specific capacity.** The ratio of capacity to physical volume.

4. **Physical storage media.**
- semiconductor
- magnetic
- optical
- quantum

4. **Access method.**
- sequential access. To access the unit of data it must start with beginning and read through a specific linear sequence. This means access time of data unit depends on position of records and previous location.
Example: magnetic tape.
- direct access. Individual block of records have unique address based on location. Access is accomplished by jumping (direct access) to general vicinity plus a sequential search to reach the final location. 
Example: magnetic disk.
- random access. The time to access a given location is independent of the sequence of prior access and is constant. Thus any location can be selected out randomly and directly addressed and accessed.
Example: RAM, ROM.
- associative access. This is random access type of memory that enables one to make a comparison of desired bit locations within a word for a specific match, and to do this for all words simultaneously.
Example: CAM (Content Addressable Memory), cache memory.

5. **Performance parameters.**
- access time. Time between presenting the address and getting the valid data.
- memory cycle time. The access time plus transient time (any additional time required before a second access can commence).
- transfer rate. This is the rate at which data can be transferred in and out of a memory unit.

6. **Data retention.**
- RAM (Random Access Memory). RAM is a read/write memory which is volatile. This means that when power is turned off, all the contents are destroyed. This is memory that can be accessed randomly: that is, any byte of memory 
can be accessed without touching the preceeding bytes. There are two basic types of RAM:
    - DRAM (Dynamic RAM). DRAM is more common type of RAM. Dynamic RAM needs to be refreshed thousand of times per second. DRAM stores a bit of data using a transistor and capacitor pair, which together comprise a memory cell. 
The capacitor holds a high or low charge (1 or 0 respectively), and the transistor acts as a switch that lets the control circuitry on the chip read the capacitor's state of charge or change it. As this form of memory is 
less expensive to produce than static RAM it is the predominant form of computer memory used in modern computers.
    - SRAM (Static RAM). SRAM does not to be refreshed, which make it faster, but it is more expensive than dynamic RAM. In static RAM a bit of data is stored using the state of flip-flop. This form of RAM is more expensive to 
produce, but is generally faster and requires less power than DRAM and in modern computers is often used as cache memory for CPU.
- ROM (Read Only Memory). ROM is non-volatile which means it retains the stored information even if power is turned off. This memory is used to store programs that boot the computer and perform diagnostics. ROM is of four 
types:
    - Masked ROM. In this ROM a bit pattern is permanently recorded by a marking and metalization process, which is an expensive and specialized one. Memory manufacturers are generally equipped to undertake this process.
    - PROM (Programmable ROM). A PROM is a memory chip on which data can be written onto only once. Once a program is written onto a PROM chip, it remains there forever. The difference between a PROM and ROM is that a PROM is 
manufactured as blank memory and programmed later with a special device called PROM programmer or PROM burner, whereas the ROM programmed during manufacturing process. The process of programming a PROM is sometimes called 
burning a PROM.
    - EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM). An EPROM is a special type of PROM that can be erased by exposing it to ultraviolet light. Once erased, it can be reprogrammed. An EPROM is similar to a PROM except that it requires 
ultraviolet radiation to be erased.
    - EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM). EEPROM is a special type of PROM that can be erased by exposing it to an electrical charge. Like other types of ROM, EEPROM is not as fast as RAM. EEPROM is similar to 
Flash Memory (sometimes called Flash EEPROM) the principal difference is that EEPROM requires data to be written or erased one byte at a time whereas Flash Memory allows data to be written or erased in blocks.


###### The Memory Hierarchy
Capacity, cost and speed of different types of memory play a vital role while designing a memory system for computers. If the memory has larger capacity, more application will get space to run smoothly. It's better 
to have fastest memory as far as possible to achieve a greater performance. Moreover for the practical system, the cost should be reasonable. There is a tradeoff between these three characteristics cost, capacity and 
access time. One cannot achieve all these quantities in the same memory module because:
- If capacity increases, access time increases (slower) and due to which cost per bit decreases.
- If access time decreases (faster), capacity decreases and due to which cost per bit increases.

So the best idea will be to use memory hierarchy.  
Memory hierarchy is to obtain the highest possible access speed while minimizing the total cost of the memory system. Not all accumulated information is needed by the CPU at the same time. Therefore, it is more economical 
to use low-cost storage devices to serve as a backup for storing the information that is not currently used by CPU. The memory unit that directly communicate with CPU is called the main memory. Devices that provide backup 
storage are called auxiliary memory. The memory hierarchy system consists of all storage devices employed in a computer system - from the slow by high-capacity auxiliary memory to a relatively faster main memory, to an even 
smaller and faster cache memory. The main memory occupies a central position by being able to communicate directly with the CPU and with auxiliary memory devices through I/O processor. A special very-high-speed memory called 
cache is used to increase the speed of processing by making current program and data available to the CPU at a rapid rate. CPU logic is usually faster than main memory access time, with the result that processing speed is 
limited primarily by the speed of main memory. The cache is used for storing segments of programs currently being executed in the CPU and temporary data frequently needed in the present calculations. The memory hierarchy 
system consists of all storage devices employed in a computer system from slow but high capacity auxiliary memory to a relatively faster cache memory accessible to high speed processing logic.
